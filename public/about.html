          <p>ZenLotusNosh - My name is Ninoshka. I am a Canadian citizen with Indian roots and Portuguese descent. I had been a competitive long distance swimmer üèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è in school and practiced yoga as part of my endurance training. I graduated as an Electrical Engineer and worked in the field for almost 10 years.</p>

        <div>
          <p>During the covid pandemic, I took a break from work and decided to rediscover my passion and traveled to India to complete Yoga Teacher Training and deepen my Yoga practice. It was during this time that I truly fell in love with Yoga, learning the meaning of yoga, its philosophy, its meditative & healing benefits, surrounded by people sharing the same passion. It changed my outlook on life - Body, Mind and Soul. I found meaning in making Yoga a bigger part of my life and sharing what I continuously learn with others that might benefit from it. Yoga means unity, unity of individual and universal consciousness.</p>
