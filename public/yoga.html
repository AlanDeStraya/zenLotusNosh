        <h2>Types of Yoga Classes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Gentle Vinyasa Flow -</strong> Looking for an invigorating mental and physical flow to relax your body and mind? Come practice a gentle vinyasa flow that incorporates continuous movement with breath that will help with fluidity and calming of the mind and mobility throughout your body. Flush out any blocks that will leave you feeling energized and have you wanting more. Open to all levels.</li>
          <li><strong>Power Flow -</strong> Strengthening and challenging vinyasa flow. Push through the limits of your body and mind and see noticeable changes in your physiological strength, mobility, balance. Learn to find equanimity of the mind to get you through challenging postures, while also training the mind to practice this off the mat.</li>
          <li><strong>Heart Opener -</strong> Leaving out any expectations you had from coming to this yoga class and let yourself feel whatever feelings might come up. Heart opening comes in many forms â€“ from postures, to breath-work, meditations, and even journaling or deep introspection.</li>
          <li><strong>Hip Opener -</strong> Tight or stiff hip flexors from sitting at an office desk too much or short-term injury? Sedentary lifestyle can cause contraction of iliopsoas or hip flexor muscles, which can be a precursor to a more serious injury. Come stretch it out, find mobility & strengthening around the hip joints, and work on improving balance. Cool it down with a relaxing cooling sequence and end in savasana leaving you with reduced stress and anxiety levels and feeling re-energized.</li>
          <li><strong>Yoga + HIIT -</strong> If you are looking for the perfect combination of slow and fast muscle training, Yoga + HIIT is the right option for you! This class helps strengthen, tone, and increase lung capacity. Followed by a deep relaxation that will help you feel invigorated and ready for any challenge that the day might present you with.</li>
          <li><strong>Yoga Nidra Exploration -</strong> Yoga nidra means sleep with awareness. When it is practiced, deeper layers of the mind are opened. The subconscious and unconscious levels of the mind are very powerful. Through yoga nidra, the nature of the mind can be changed, diseases can be cured, and creativity improved.
          <br />
            It can be practiced by training the mind using sankalpa. Sankalpa is a Sanskrit word, which translates as an intention. It is a short mental statement, which is implanted in the subconscious mind when it is receptive and sensitive to autosuggestion during yoga nidra. It is a powerful method of reshaping the personality and direction in life along positive lines.</li>

        <h2>Yoga Poses</h2>
        <h3>Breakdown and Benefits</h3>
        <p><strong>Bridge Pose -</strong> It is a mild inversion pose that can be both energizing and restorative. When the sacrum is supported by a block it is more therapeutic and revitalizing.</p>
        <p><strong>Child's Pose -</strong> In child's pose, you can find tension release in the back, neck, and shoulders. On the mental and emotional level, it promotes a steady, even, and elongated breath, which creates a deep sense of calm and relaxation.</p>
        <p><strong>Downward Dog -</strong> Expand chest muscles and contract upper back muscles. Pull shoulder blades together. Counter stretch to sitting at a desk for extended periods of time and finding length in the spine. </p>
        <p><strong>Warrior -</strong> Root through the outer edge of your back foot and lunge with your front leg parallel to the mat. Squeeze glutes to contract these muscles and extend or stretch the hip flexor muscles. The Warrior Pose is symbolic for finding your determination, mission, purpose, & duty. Exalted warrior represents setting up healthy boundaries for yourself with the external.</p>
